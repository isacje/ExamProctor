# Online-Examination-System
Online Examination System using Python and Django.

# Overview
This project is a fully functional Online Examination System developed using the Python Django web framework. It is designed for educational institutions, allowing students to take exams online, while teachers and administrators manage courses, questions, and student records efficiently. This system is ideal for IT students in their first or second year, and it simulates a real-life examination environment with an intuitive user interface.

# Key Features
## Student Panel
* Register and login to access exams
* View available courses and exam sets
* Attend multiple-choice questions (MCQ) based exams
* View marks and number of attempts post-submission

## Teacher Panel
* Account approval required from admin for activation
* Manage courses by adding questions, options, and correct answers
* View total number of students enrolled

## Admin Panel
* Full control of the system, including user management
* Approve or decline teacher accounts and set teacher salaries
* Manage courses and questions sets similar to the teacher role
* View student marks and exam attempts

## Technologies Used
* Backend: Python, Django Web Framework
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
* Database: SQLite

# Automatic Detection of Students’ Engagement During Online Learning

## Project Overview
This project proposes a system to automatically detect student engagement in online learning environments using a bagging ensemble deep learning approach. The system analyzes real-time facial expressions and classifies engagement levels, enabling educators to adapt teaching strategies effectively.

## Features
- Utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **ResNet architectures**.
- Employs pre-trained models like **ResNet18** and **ResNet50** with transfer learning.
- Processes data from the **DAiSEE** dataset for comprehensive analysis.
- Real-time detection of engagement levels: **Very Low**, **Low**, **High**, and **Very High**.
- Supports multimodal data, including facial expressions, head movements, and eye tracking.

## System Architecture
The project consists of:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizing and preparing data.
2. **Feature Reduction**: Using techniques like SVD for dimensionality reduction.
3. **Model Training**: Bagging ensemble of ResNet models.
4. **Ensemble Prediction**: Aggregating predictions using a soft voting mechanism.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Testing and analyzing model accuracy.

## Requirements

### Software
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later
- **Programming Language**: Python
- Libraries: OpenFace, TensorFlow, Keras

### Hardware
- **Processor**: Intel i3 or above
- **RAM**: 8 GB or more
- **Storage**: 500 GB or more
- **Webcam**: Internal/External for video capture

## Results
- Achieved **99.8% accuracy** using ResNet18 for engagement detection.
- Effectively identifies emotions like happiness, anger, and surprise.

## Future Work
- Explore additional modalities for enhanced accuracy.
- Expand to diverse educational settings and course structures.
